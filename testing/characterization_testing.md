# Characterization Testing

Characterization Testing is about testing _**behavior**_, not _**correctness**_. Without thinking about software specifications, you can just record behavior given certain input.

## Utility
When is it useful to test like this? 

- When we want to build knowledge about what the code actually does, how the application actually _**behaves**_. Characterization testing is great when performed prior to a **refactor** or **rewrite**.

What happens when a character test uncovers undocumented behavior? Is it a bug by default? 
- Not necessarily, that depends on the context. In fact, users may have become accustomed to this behavior and expect the feature to exist.
> "When a system goes into production, in a way, it becomes its own specification. We need to know when we are changing existing behavior regardless of whether we think itâ€™s right or not."

It's best to leave the test and record this behavior so its no longer undocumented and future changes can be tested against this behavior.
